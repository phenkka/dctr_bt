It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.",

When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.",

The 2016 NSCH also found that anxiety conditions were more common in non-Hispanic White children compared with children of other racial or ethnic backgrounds. However, recent cohorts of Black children or adolescents have reported a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders than in the past. Multiple factors, ranging from socioeconomic status, childhood adversity, family structure, and neighborhood effects, may influence patterns of prevalence by race or ethnicity. Adverse childhood experiences influence the likelihood of experiencing mental health conditions such as anxiety. Adverse childhood experiences may result from a complex interaction of familial, peer, or societal factors, including racial discrimination. These adverse childhood experiences may be blatant or subtle (eg, microaggressions) but are potentially traumatic events that, in the context of historic trauma, structural racism, and biopsychological vulnerability, can worsen mental health outcomes. Combined with lower engagement with mental health services, adverse childhood experiences can result in high levels of unmet mental health needs in Black youth. Similar patterns of historic trauma, adverse childhood experiences, and substance abuse may also explain higher rates of mental health disorders in Native American/Alaska Native youth.",

Some women at lower risk for breast cancer have also been included in trials documenting reduced risk for breast cancer when taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors.3, 4 However, when balancing the harms associated with these medications, the net benefit will be lower among women at lower risk.\r\nAlternatively, clinicians may use combinations of risk factors (including some risk factors not included in risk assessment tools but that would have permitted enrollment in some of the risk reduction trials) to identify women at increased risk. Some examples of combinations of multiple risk factors in women at increased risk include (but are not limited to) age 65 years or older with 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer; 45 years or older with more than 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer or 1 first-degree relative who developed breast cancer before age 50 years; 40 years or older with a first-degree relative with bilateral breast cancer; presence of atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ on a prior biopsy.\r\nWomen not at increased risk for breast cancer, such as women younger than 60 years with no additional risk factors for breast cancer, or women with a low 5-year risk of breast cancer should not be routinely offered medications to reduce risk of breast cancer, since the risk of harms from these medications likely outweighs their potential benefit.\r\nWhen considering prescribing breast cancer risk-reducing medications, potential benefit of risk reduction of breast cancer must be balanced against the potential harms of adverse medication effects.

Individual factors (eg, age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or genetic predisposition) also may serve as risk factors across mental health conditions. Other psychosocial risk factors include childhood abuse or neglect, exposure to traumatic events, bullying (either as perpetrators or as victims), adverse life events, early exposure to stress, maltreatment, and an insecure parental relationship.\r\nRecent cohorts of Black children and adolescents have reported a higher prevalence of suicide rates, increase in suicide attempts, and greater increases in the prevalence of depression than in the past. Reasons for this increase may be due to multiple factors such as socioeconomic status, family structure, neighborhood effects, and childhood adversity. Adverse childhood experiences influence the likelihood of experiencing mental health conditions such as depression. Adverse childhood experiences may result from a complex interaction of familial, peer, or societal factors.&nbsp; These adverse childhood experiences may be blatant or subtle (eg, microaggressions) but are potentially traumatic events that, in the context of historic trauma, structural racism, and biopsychological vulnerability, can worsen mental health outcomes. Combined with lower engagement with mental health services, adverse childhood experiences can result in high levels of unmet need in Black youth.&nbsp;Similar patterns of historic trauma, adverse childhood experiences, and substance abuse may also explain higher rates of mental health disorders in Native American/Alaska Native youth.",

It is difficult to identify specific components of exercise that are particularly effective. The most commonly studied exercise components were gait, balance, and functional training, followed by strength and resistance training, flexibility, and endurance training. A smaller number of trials included a 3-dimensional exercise (ie, exercise that involves movement through all 3 spatial planes or dimensions: forward and back, side to side, and up and down), such as group dance or tai chi classes. The most common frequency and duration for exercise interventions was 2 to 3 sessions per week for 12 months, although duration of exercise interventions ranged from 2 to 30 months.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIt is important to note that physical activity is associated with multiple health benefits in addition to fall prevention. For example, regular physical activity has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease events, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all-cause mortality, as well as lower blood pressure, lower risk of type 2 diabetes, and lower risk of dyslipidemia.5-7 The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults do at least 150 to 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity, or 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, as well as muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity and that involve all major muscle groups twice a week or more.5\r\n&nbsp;\r\nMultifactorial interventions include an initial assessment of modifiable risk factors for falls and subsequent customized interventions for each patient based on issues identified in the initial assessment. The initial assessment could include a multidisciplinary comprehensive geriatric assessment or an assessment using a combination of various components, such as balance, gait, vision, postural blood pressure, medication, environment, cognition, and psychological health. This comprehensive assessment should be distinguished from the evaluation and treatment of a patient who presents with a specific symptom or concern (eg, reduced vision or lower extremity pain or numbness). In studies, assessments were conducted by nursing professionals, physicians, or physical or occupational therapists, and a variety of different professionals performed subsequent interventions, including nurses, clinicians, physical therapists, exercise instructors, occupational therapists, dietitians, or nutritionists. Intervention components vary based on the initial assessment and could include group or individual exercise, psychological interventions (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy), nutrition therapy, education, medication management, urinary incontinence management, environmental modification, physical or occupational therapy, social or community services, and referral to specialists (eg, ophthalmologist, neurologist, or cardiologist).4",

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy can quickly evolve into severe disease that can result in serious, even fatal, maternal and infant health outcomes. The ability to screen for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy using blood pressure measurements is important to identify and effectively treat a potentially unpredictable and fatal condition. While it is known that risk continues into the immediate postpartum period, there is little evidence regarding screening during this period. A pragmatic approach would be for patients to be counseled regarding signs and symptoms of preeclampsia at hospital discharge and for patients with hypertensive disorders to have subsequent blood pressure checks.\r\nScreening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy alone is not sufficient to improve inequities in health outcomes. Identifying hypertensive disorders of pregnancy requires adequate prenatal visits, surveillance, and evidence-based care in response to evolving patient signs and symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period to improve health outcomes. Black and Native American/Alaska Native persons have lower rates of prenatal visits and are at greater risk of serious postpartum morbidity and hospital readmission after delivery. Screening and monitoring of Black and Hispanic/Latina individuals during the postpartum period could be an important step for reducing health inequities by preventing serious adverse events. In addition, screening and monitoring by various health care providers (eg, nurse midwives, nurses, pediatricians, doulas, and lactation consultants) could also help avert serious complications in the postpartum period.",

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations. Clinicians seeking further information about testing for tuberculosis in these populations can refer to the Additional Tools and Resources and Recommendations of Others sections.",

Men have a higher overall CVD disease burden, although women experience higher mortality from certain cardiovascular events, such as stroke. Men tend to experience CVD events earlier in life compared with women. The burden of CVD also differs by race and ethnicity. Among both sexes, Black persons have the highest prevalence of CVD.\r\n \r\n&nbsp;\r\n \r\nThe American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Pooled Cohort Equations may be used to estimate 10-year risk of CVD. The ACC/AHA risk estimator is, to date, the only US-based CVD risk prediction tool that has published external validation studies in other US-based populations. The estimator has separate equations based on sex and for Black persons and non-Black persons, which include the risk factors of age, cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure level, antihypertension treatment, presence of diabetes, and smoking status, and focuses on hard clinical outcomes (myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease; ischemic stroke and stroke-related death) as the outcomes of interest. It is important to note that increasing age heavily influences the ACC/AHA estimated 10-year CVD event risk. The risk prediction equations generally show higher risk for Black persons than White persons. The USPSTF recognizes that race is a social construct and an imperfect proxy for social determinants of health and the effects of structural racism. Concerns about calibration exist, with many external validation studies showing overprediction in broad populations (men and women across racial and ethnic groups). Limited evidence also suggests underprediction in disadvantaged communities&nbsp;that could lead to underutilization of preventive therapies. Clinicians should recognize that predictions of 10-year CVD events using the Pooled Cohort Equations are estimates.\r\n \r\n&nbsp;\r\n \r\nBleeding Risk\r\n \r\nThe risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic stroke, with or without aspirin use, increases with older age. Other risk factors include male sex, diabetes, history of gastrointestinal issues (such as peptic ulcer disease), liver disease, smoking, and elevated blood pressure. Certain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and anticoagulants, increase the risk of bleeding.&nbsp;These risk factors should be considered in the overall decision about whether to start or continue aspirin therapy.\r\n ",

It is difficult to identify specific components of exercise that are particularly effective. The most commonly studied exercise components were gait, balance, and functional training, followed by strength and resistance training, flexibility, and endurance training. A smaller number of trials included a 3-dimensional exercise (ie, exercise that involves movement through all 3 spatial planes or dimensions: forward and back, side to side, and up and down), such as group dance or tai chi classes. The most common frequency and duration for exercise interventions was 2 to 3 sessions per week for 12 months, although duration of exercise interventions ranged from 2 to 30 months.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIt is important to note that physical activity is associated with multiple health benefits in addition to fall prevention. For example, regular physical activity has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease events, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all-cause mortality, as well as lower blood pressure, lower risk of type 2 diabetes, and lower risk of dyslipidemia.5-7 The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults do at least 150 to 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity, or 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, as well as muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity and that involve all major muscle groups twice a week or more.5\r\n&nbsp;\r\nMultifactorial interventions include an initial assessment of modifiable risk factors for falls and subsequent customized interventions for each patient based on issues identified in the initial assessment. The initial assessment could include a multidisciplinary comprehensive geriatric assessment or an assessment using a combination of various components, such as balance, gait, vision, postural blood pressure, medication, environment, cognition, and psychological health. This comprehensive assessment should be distinguished from the evaluation and treatment of a patient who presents with a specific symptom or concern (eg, reduced vision or lower extremity pain or numbness). In studies, assessments were conducted by nursing professionals, physicians, or physical or occupational therapists, and a variety of different professionals performed subsequent interventions, including nurses, clinicians, physical therapists, exercise instructors, occupational therapists, dietitians, or nutritionists. Intervention components vary based on the initial assessment and could include group or individual exercise, psychological interventions (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy), nutrition therapy, education, medication management, urinary incontinence management, environmental modification, physical or occupational therapy, social or community services, and referral to specialists (eg, ophthalmologist, neurologist, or cardiologist).4",

There is no single cutoff for defining increased risk for all women. Women at greater risk, such as those with at least a 3% risk for breast cancer in the next 5 years, are likely to derive more benefit than harm from risk-reducing medications6 and should be offered these medications if their risk of harms is low. Some women at lower risk for breast cancer have also been included in trials documenting reduced risk for breast cancer when taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors.3, 4 However, when balancing the harms associated with these medications, the net benefit will be lower among women at lower risk.\r\nAlternatively, clinicians may use combinations of risk factors (including some risk factors not included in risk assessment tools but that would have permitted enrollment in some of the risk reduction trials) to identify women at increased risk. Some examples of combinations of multiple risk factors in women at increased risk include (but are not limited to) age 65 years or older with 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer; 45 years or older with more than 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer or 1 first-degree relative who developed breast cancer before age 50 years; 40 years or older with a first-degree relative with bilateral breast cancer; presence of atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ on a prior biopsy.\r\nWomen not at increased risk for breast cancer, such as women younger than 60 years with no additional risk factors for breast cancer, or women with a low 5-year risk of breast cancer should not be routinely offered medications to reduce risk of breast cancer, since the risk of harms from these medications likely outweighs their potential benefit.\r\nWhen considering prescribing breast cancer risk-reducing medications, potential benefit of risk reduction of breast cancer must be balanced against the potential harms of adverse medication effects.

Additional risk factors include male sex, older age, use of betel quid, ultraviolet light exposure, infection with Candida or bacterial flora, and a compromised immune system.

In the United States, the prevalence of oropharyngeal cancer due to oral HPV infection is probably as high as 80% to 95%. The prevalence of oral HPV infection is associated with age, sex, number of sexual partners, and number of cigarettes smoked per day.
