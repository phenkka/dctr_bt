It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established. Men who have sex with men or persons with HIV infection may benefit from screening at least annually or more frequently (eg, every 3 to 6 months) if they continue to be at high risk.', 'risktext': 'The USPSTF recommends screening for syphilis in persons who are at increased risk for infection. When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations. A pragmatic approach in the absence of evidence might include screening all adults who have not been screened previously and using clinical judgment in considering risk factors, comorbid conditions, and life events to determine if additional screening of high-risk patients is warranted. Ongoing assessment of risks that may develop during pregnancy and the postpartum period is also a reasonable approach.', 'risktext': 'Assessment of Risk\r\nRisk factors for anxiety disorders include sociodemographic factors, psychosocial factors, and physical and mental health factors such as marital status (widowed or divorced), stressful life events, smoking and alcohol use, other mental health conditions, or a parental history of mental disorders. Demographic factors such as low socioeconomic status and female sex are associated with higher rates of anxiety disorders.&nbsp;Black persons and individuals of non-Hispanic ethnicity are at increased risk of anxiety disorders due to social, rather than biological, factors. Anxiety and depressive disorders often overlap. One cohort study found that 67% of individuals with a depressive disorder also had a current anxiety disorder, and 75% had a lifetime comorbid anxiety disorder.'}, {'title': 'Latent Tuberculosis Infection in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk.\r\rSee the "Assessment of Risk" section for additional information on adults at increased risk.', 'servfreq': 'The USPSTF found no evidence on the optimal frequency of screening for LTBI. In the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk factors; screening frequency could range from 1-time only screening among persons at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those at continued risk of exposure.', 'risktext': 'Populations at increased risk for LTBI, based on increased prevalence of active disease and increased risk of exposure, include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with high tuberculosis prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (eg, homeless shelters or correctional facilities). Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established. Men who have sex with men or persons with HIV infection may benefit from screening at least annually or more frequently (eg, every 3 to 6 months) if they continue to be at high risk.', 'risktext': 'The USPSTF recommends screening for syphilis in persons who are at increased risk for infection. When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

In the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk factors; screening frequency could range from 1-time only screening among persons at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those at continued risk of exposure.', 'risktext': 'Populations at increased risk for LTBI, based on increased prevalence of active disease and increased risk of exposure, include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with high tuberculosis prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (eg, homeless shelters or correctional facilities). Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'title': 'Rh(D) Incompatibility: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI strongly recommends Rh(D) blood typing and antibody testing for all pregnant women during their first visit for pregnancy-related care.', 'servfreq': 'First prenatal visit.', 'risktext': ''}, {'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

Additional risk factors include having anal intercourse without a condom, having vaginal intercourse without a condom and with more than 1 partner whose HIV status is unknown, exchanging sex for drugs or money (transactional sex), having other STIs or a sex partner with an STI, and having a sex partner who is living with HIV or is in a high-risk category.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established. Men who have sex with men or persons with HIV infection may benefit from screening at least annually or more frequently (eg, every 3 to 6 months) if they continue to be at high risk.', 'risktext': 'The USPSTF recommends screening for syphilis in persons who are at increased risk for infection. When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

In the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk factors; screening frequency could range from 1-time only screening among persons at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those at continued risk of exposure.', 'risktext': 'Populations at increased risk for LTBI, based on increased prevalence of active disease and increased risk of exposure, include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with high tuberculosis prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (eg, homeless shelters or correctional facilities). Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

In the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk factors; screening frequency could range from 1-time only screening among persons at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those at continued risk of exposure.', 'risktext': 'Populations at increased risk for LTBI, based on increased prevalence of active disease and increased risk of exposure, include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with high tuberculosis prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (eg, homeless shelters or correctional facilities). Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

In the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk factors; screening frequency could range from 1-time only screening among persons at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those at continued risk of exposure.', 'risktext': 'Populations at increased risk for LTBI, based on increased prevalence of active disease and increased risk of exposure, include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with high tuberculosis prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (eg, homeless shelters or correctional facilities). Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

In the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk factors; screening frequency could range from 1-time only screening among persons at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those at continued risk of exposure.', 'risktext': 'Populations at increased risk for LTBI, based on increased prevalence of active disease and increased risk of exposure, include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with high tuberculosis prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (eg, homeless shelters or correctional facilities). Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

In the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk factors; screening frequency could range from 1-time only screening among persons at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those at continued risk of exposure.', 'risktext': 'Populations at increased risk for LTBI, based on increased prevalence of active disease and increased risk of exposure, include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with high tuberculosis prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (eg, homeless shelters or correctional facilities). Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

In the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk factors; screening frequency could range from 1-time only screening among persons at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those at continued risk of exposure.', 'risktext': 'Populations at increased risk for LTBI, based on increased prevalence of active disease and increased risk of exposure, include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with high tuberculosis prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (eg, homeless shelters or correctional facilities). Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

Men have a higher overall CVD disease burden, although women experience higher mortality from certain cardiovascular events, such as stroke. Men tend to experience CVD events earlier in life compared with women. The burden of CVD also differs by race and ethnicity. Among both sexes, Black persons have the highest prevalence of CVD.\r\n \r\n&nbsp;\r\n \r\nThe American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Pooled Cohort Equations may be used to estimate 10-year risk of CVD. The ACC/AHA risk estimator is, to date, the only US-based CVD risk prediction tool that has published external validation studies in other US-based populations. The estimator has separate equations based on sex and for Black persons and non-Black persons, which include the risk factors of age, cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure level, antihypertension treatment, presence of diabetes, and smoking status, and focuses on hard clinical outcomes (myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease; ischemic stroke and stroke-related death) as the outcomes of interest. It is important to note that increasing age heavily influences the ACC/AHA estimated 10-year CVD event risk. The risk prediction equations generally show higher risk for Black persons than White persons. The USPSTF recognizes that race is a social construct and an imperfect proxy for social determinants of health and the effects of structural racism. Concerns about calibration exist, with many external validation studies showing overprediction in broad populations (men and women across racial and ethnic groups). Limited evidence also suggests underprediction in disadvantaged communities&nbsp;that could lead to underutilization of preventive therapies. Clinicians should recognize that predictions of 10-year CVD events using the Pooled Cohort Equations are estimates.\r\n \r\n&nbsp;\r\n \r\nBleeding Risk\r\n \r\nThe risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic stroke, with or without aspirin use, increases with older age. Other risk factors include male sex, diabetes, history of gastrointestinal issues (such as peptic ulcer disease), liver disease, smoking, and elevated blood pressure. Certain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and anticoagulants, increase the risk of bleeding.&nbsp;These risk factors should be considered in the overall decision about whether to start or continue aspirin therapy.\r\n '}, {'id': 1979, 'title': 'Healthy Diet and Physical Activity for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Adults Without Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors: Behavioral Counseling Interventions ', 'grade': 'C', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians individualize the decision to offer or refer adults without cardiovascular disease risk factors to behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthy diet and physical activity. \r\rSee the "Practice Considerations" section for information on determining which patients may benefit most from this service.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 403, 'title': 'Skin Cancer Prevention: Behavioral Counseling ', 'grade': 'C', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians selectively offer counseling to adults older than 24 years with fair skin types about minimizing their exposure to UV radiation to reduce risk of skin cancer.

However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

The ACC/AHA risk estimator is, to date, the only US-based CVD risk prediction tool that has published external validation studies in other US-based populations. The estimator has separate equations based on sex and for Black persons and non-Black persons, which include the risk factors of age, cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure level, antihypertension treatment, presence of diabetes, and smoking status, and focuses on hard clinical outcomes (myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease; ischemic stroke and stroke-related death) as the outcomes of interest.

The risk prediction equations generally show higher risk for Black persons than White persons. The USPSTF recognizes that race is a social construct and an imperfect proxy for social determinants of health and the effects of structural racism.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1906, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

Men tend to experience CVD events earlier in life compared with women. The burden of CVD also differs by race and ethnicity. Among both sexes, Black persons have the highest prevalence of CVD.\r\n \r\n&nbsp;\r\n \r\nThe American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Pooled Cohort Equations may be used to estimate 10-year risk of CVD. The ACC/AHA risk estimator is, to date, the only US-based CVD risk prediction tool that has published external validation studies in other US-based populations. The estimator has separate equations based on sex and for Black persons and non-Black persons, which include the risk factors of age, cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure level, antihypertension treatment, presence of diabetes, and smoking status, and focuses on hard clinical outcomes (myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease; ischemic stroke and stroke-related death) as the outcomes of interest. It is important to note that increasing age heavily influences the ACC/AHA estimated 10-year CVD event risk. The risk prediction equations generally show higher risk for Black persons than White persons. The USPSTF recognizes that race is a social construct and an imperfect proxy for social determinants of health and the effects of structural racism. Concerns about calibration exist, with many external validation studies showing overprediction in broad populations (men and women across racial and ethnic groups). Limited evidence also suggests underprediction in disadvantaged communities&nbsp;that could lead to underutilization of preventive therapies.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 186, 'title': 'Rh(D) Incompatibility: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI strongly recommends Rh(D) blood typing and antibody testing for all pregnant women during their first visit for pregnancy-related care.', 'servfreq': 'First prenatal visit.', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy can quickly evolve into severe disease that can result in serious, even fatal, maternal and infant health outcomes. The ability to screen for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy using blood pressure measurements is important to identify and effectively treat a potentially unpredictable and fatal condition. While it is known that risk continues into the immediate postpartum period, there is little evidence regarding screening during this period. A pragmatic approach would be for patients to be counseled regarding signs and symptoms of preeclampsia at hospital discharge and for patients with hypertensive disorders to have subsequent blood pressure checks.\r\nScreening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy alone is not sufficient to improve inequities in health outcomes. Identifying hypertensive disorders of pregnancy requires adequate prenatal visits, surveillance, and evidence-based care in response to evolving patient signs and symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period to improve health outcomes.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 186, 'title': 'Rh(D) Incompatibility: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI strongly recommends Rh(D) blood typing and antibody testing for all pregnant women during their first visit for pregnancy-related care.', 'servfreq': 'First prenatal visit.', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US.

Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities.

This difference likely reflects traits associated with increased melanoma risk, such as fair skin (which is more susceptible to sunburning), light-colored eyes, and red or blond hair being more common among White persons compared with persons of other races and ethnicities. Acral lentiginous melanoma, which occurs mostly on skin not frequently exposed to direct sunlight (eg, palms of hands, soles of feet, or under fingernails or toenails), is the most common type of melanoma among Black populations.

All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 186, 'title': 'Rh(D) Incompatibility: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI strongly recommends Rh(D) blood typing and antibody testing for all pregnant women during their first visit for pregnancy-related care.', 'servfreq': 'First prenatal visit.', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs.

Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 186, 'title': 'Rh(D) Incompatibility: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI strongly recommends Rh(D) blood typing and antibody testing for all pregnant women during their first visit for pregnancy-related care.', 'servfreq': 'First prenatal visit.', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US.

Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex.

Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load.

A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs.

Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 186, 'title': 'Rh(D) Incompatibility: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI strongly recommends Rh(D) blood typing and antibody testing for all pregnant women during their first visit for pregnancy-related care.', 'servfreq': 'First prenatal visit.', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection.

All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex.

Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 186, 'title': 'Rh(D) Incompatibility: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI strongly recommends Rh(D) blood typing and antibody testing for all pregnant women during their first visit for pregnancy-related care.', 'servfreq': 'First prenatal visit.', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 186, 'title': 'Rh(D) Incompatibility: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI strongly recommends Rh(D) blood typing and antibody testing for all pregnant women during their first visit for pregnancy-related care.', 'servfreq': 'First prenatal visit.', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy can quickly evolve into severe disease that can result in serious, even fatal, maternal and infant health outcomes. The ability to screen for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy using blood pressure measurements is important to identify and effectively treat a potentially unpredictable and fatal condition. While it is known that risk continues into the immediate postpartum period, there is little evidence regarding screening during this period. A pragmatic approach would be for patients to be counseled regarding signs and symptoms of preeclampsia at hospital discharge and for patients with hypertensive disorders to have subsequent blood pressure checks.\r\nScreening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy alone is not sufficient to improve inequities in health outcomes. Identifying hypertensive disorders of pregnancy requires adequate prenatal visits, surveillance, and evidence-based care in response to evolving patient signs and symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period to improve health outcomes.

All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 186, 'title': 'Rh(D) Incompatibility: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI strongly recommends Rh(D) blood typing and antibody testing for all pregnant women during their first visit for pregnancy-related care.', 'servfreq': 'First prenatal visit.', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

Acral lentiginous melanoma, which occurs mostly on skin not frequently exposed to direct sunlight (eg, palms of hands, soles of feet, or under fingernails or toenails), is the most common type of melanoma among Black populations.

All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 186, 'title': 'Rh(D) Incompatibility: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI strongly recommends Rh(D) blood typing and antibody testing for all pregnant women during their first visit for pregnancy-related care.', 'servfreq': 'First prenatal visit.', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities.

Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex.

A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations.

The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

In the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk factors; screening frequency could range from 1-time only screening among persons at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those at continued risk of exposure.', 'risktext': 'Populations at increased risk for LTBI, based on increased prevalence of active disease and increased risk of exposure, include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with high tuberculosis prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (eg, homeless shelters or correctional facilities). Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

In the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk factors; screening frequency could range from 1-time only screening among persons at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those at continued risk of exposure.', 'risktext': 'Populations at increased risk for LTBI, based on increased prevalence of active disease and increased risk of exposure, include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with high tuberculosis prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (eg, homeless shelters or correctional facilities). Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.\r\nRisk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex. A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs. The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.&nbsp;Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.\r\n&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.\r\n&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n2. &nbsp; Persons who inject drugs and have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV or who shares injection equipment.\r\nPersons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).\r\nIn addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.&nbsp;It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.\r\nAll persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.'}, {'id': 1989, 'title': 'Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.', 'servfreq': 'Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established.

For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service. A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner). Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.9,10 Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.'}, {'id': 1905, 'title': 'Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions ', 'grade': 'A', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco.', 'servfreq': '', 'risktext': ''}, {'id': 2014, 'title': 'Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Screening ', 'grade': 'B', 'text': 'The DoctorAI recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.', 'servfreq': 'Screening Intervals\r\nThere is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations.

Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.\r\nIn 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US. According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases. Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.\r\nPersons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities. It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).\r\nOther populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.\r\nPersons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations.
